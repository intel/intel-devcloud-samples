    "This sample application demonstrates how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform people counting.

    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",

    "  - Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes in the output\n",
    "- Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",

    "## People counter application\n",
    "\n",
    "The people counter application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to detect people within each frame.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) to download the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the people counter application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified input image or video to detect people.  When a person is detected, a box is drawn around the person on the output frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU and Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<architecture>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
