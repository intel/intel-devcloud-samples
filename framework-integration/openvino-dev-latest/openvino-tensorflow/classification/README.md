### Object Detection

This example introduces the powerful capabilities Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model (mobilenet-ssd) to detect vehicles in a pre-recorded video clip. This example demonstrates key concepts of OpenVINO, such as the quantization of a model to INT8 using the Post-Training Optimization Toolkit and how to submit jobs to edge hardware to accelerate the inferencing on Intel® Core™ CPUs, Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1268L v5, Intel® HD Graphics 530 or Intel® Movidius™ VPU.
