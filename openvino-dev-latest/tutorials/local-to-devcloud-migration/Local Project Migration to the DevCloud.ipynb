    "## Understanding what the DevCloud does/does not do\n",
    "The Intel DevCloud for the Edge is a useful tool for quickly prototyping, developing and optimizing a new application or importing an existing application and then analyzing the application performance across multiple hardware environments. Since the hardware is in the cloud, it is not necessary to purchase specific hardware on which to run your application until you are closer to deploying it. The DevCloud environment uses consistent interfaces to the AI tools to facilitate being able to deploy on multiple types of hardware. An overview of the DevCloud for the Edge can be found at [here](https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/get_started/devcloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How components of the DevCloud translate to local environments\n",
    "\n",
    "From the illustration below some components of the DevCloud are not present or different in a local execution environment. The circled numbers refer to the DevCloud graphic below. \n",
    "- The HTTP browser❶ access to Development Servers❷ is typically used to replace direct terminal access in your local environment\n",
    "- Your local development machine replaces the Development Servers❷ and the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "- The Storage Server, accessed as `/data` within the Development Server environment, likely does not exist in your local environment. If you have large datasets, you may want to upload them to `/data` when migrating to the DevCloud.\n",
    "- The Job Queue❸ is the means within the DevCloud to share access to limited hardware resources❹ in the cloud. Your local deployment environment will typically have only one hardware resource and dedicated access. In order to take advantage of shared hardware environments, you local application will need to be adapted to use the queuing system to access that hardware.\n",
    "- Instead of viewing output directly in your local environment, your application will need to be adapted to store/view the Inference Video/Image Output❺ and the Results❻ via an HTTP browser.\n",
