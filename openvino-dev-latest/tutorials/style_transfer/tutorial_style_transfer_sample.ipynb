    "The purpose of this tutorial is to examine a sample application that was created using the [Intel® Distribution of OpenViNO™ toolkit (Open Visual Inference & Neural Network Optimization)](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit).  This tutorial will go step-by-step through the necessary steps to demonstrate style transfer on images and video .  Style transfer, where the style of one image is transferred to another as if recreated using the same style, is performed using a pre-trained network and running it using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Inference Engine.  Inference will be executed using the same CPU(s) running this Jupyter* Notebook.\n",

    "#### Intel® distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit overview and terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with a brief overview of the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit and what this tutorial will be covering.  The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit enables the quick deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for heterogeneous execution on Intel® hardware while maximizing performance. This is done using the Intel® Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit (Intel® DLDT) included within the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit with its main components shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image alt text](./doc_openvino_overview_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a tool, such as Caffe*, to create and train a CNN inference model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the created model through Model Optimizer to produce an optimized Intermediate Representation (IR) stored in files (`.bin` and `.xml`) for use with the Inference Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The User Application then loads and runs models on devices using the Inference Engine and the IR files  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on the last step, the User Application and using the Inference Engine to run a model on a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the inference engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a more detailed view of the User Application and Inference Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image alt text](./doc_inference_engine_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inference Engine includes a plugin library for each supported device that has been optimized for the Intel® hardware device CPU, GPU, and VPU.  From here, we will use the terms \"device\" and “plugin” with the assumption that one infers the other (e.g. CPU device infers the CPU plugin and vice versa).  As part of loading the model, the User Application tells the Inference Engine which device to target which in turn loads the associated plugin library to later run on the associated device. The Inference Engine uses “blobs” for all data exchanges, basically arrays in memory arranged according the input and output data of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Inference engine API integration flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the inference engine API follows the basic steps outlined briefly below.  The API objects and functions will be seen later in the sample code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the model IR\n",

    "### Input preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the dimensions of the input data does not match the required dimensions of the input data for the inference model.  A common example is an input video frame.  Before the image may be input to the inference model, the input must be preprocessed to match the required dimensions for the inference model as well as channels (i.e. colors) and batch size (number of images present).  The basic step performed is to resize the frame from the source dimensions to match the required dimensions of the inference model’s input, reorganizing any dimensions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial and the many samples in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit use OpenCV to perform resizing of input data.  The basic steps performed using OpenCV are:\n",

    "1.  Resize image dimensions form image to model's input W x H:<br>\n",
