    "The robotic instrument segmentation application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to locate robotic instruments within each frame.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",

Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified input video to identify segments of robotic instruments.  Once identified, each robotic instrument segment is colored to highlight it on the output video.\n",

The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
