    "\n",
    "To perform brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) the U-Net architecture is used to segment brain tumors from raw MRI scans. With relatively little data a U-Net model can be trained to accurately predict where tumors exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dice coefficient (the standard metric for the BraTS dataset used in the study) for our model is about 0.82-0.88.  [Menze et al. reported](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6975210/) that expert neuroradiologists manually segmented these tumors with a cross-rater Dice score of 0.75-0.85, meaning that the model’s predictions are on par with what expert physicians have made. The below MRI brain scans show highlighted brain tumor matter segmented using a trained model. \n",

    "### What is U-Net?\n",
    "Since its introduction two years ago, the [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597) architecture has been used to create deep learning models for segmenting [nerves](https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation) in ultrasound images, [lungs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017#tutorial) in CT scans, and even [interference](https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet) in radio telescopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of U-Net is designed like an [auto-encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder). It has an encoding path (“contracting”) paired with a decoding path (“expanding”) which gives it the `U` shape.  However, in contrast to the autoencoder, U-Net predicts a pixel-wise segmentation map of the input image rather than classifying the input image as a whole. For each pixel in the original image, it asks the question: “To which class does this pixel belong?” This flexibility allows U-Net to predict different parts of the tumor simultaneously.\n",

    "## Brain tumor segmentation application\n",
    "The brain tumor segmentation application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on a raw MRI input image to segment brain tumor matter within the image.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) to create the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the brain tumor segmentation application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the supplied raw MRI images to segment brain tumors.  The result is a combined image comprising a set of three images: The MRI input, ground truth, and the predicted output from inference with Dice score.  The combined image is also annotated with the amount of time to do inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU and Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<architecture>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `outputHTML` image display utility.\n",
