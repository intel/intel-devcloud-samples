    "Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli.\n",
    "Typically symptoms include some combination of cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing [1].\n",
    "Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year [2]. To diagnose this disease, chest X-ray images remain the best diagnostic tool.\n",

The topology used is the DenseNet 121 which is an architecture that has shown to be very efficient at this problem.  DenseNet 121 is the first work to claim a classification rate better than practicing radiologists.

    "A Class Activation Map (CAM) [1] is a technique to visualize the regions that are relevant within a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the specific class in the image. \n",
    "The CAM $M(x,y)$ is calculated from the *N* feature maps $f_i(x,y)$ within the last convolutional layer of the network.

    "In order to get the feature maps, inference must be performed first to get the results. The `res` argument in the code above is the inference output which includes the feature maps by using `add_outputs()`.\n",

Before doing the weighted sum, if the FP16 model is being used, the weights and feature maps value must be converted from type `float16`to type `float` using the function `float16_conversion_array()`. The weighted sum of the weights is then done with the feature maps. \n",
